## How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
<p>Coming into this course I was new to computer graphics and using OpenGL in particular. All the skills that I have developed during this
course and while working on this project are new skills to me. All the design skills from camera view, angle and movement to object rendering, transformations
and placement are new concepts to me that I developed through this course and while working on this project. </p>

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
 <p>Each module in this course built of the last. It began with learning about how to initalize and create a windown, then about the different kinds of shaders 
and their uses and how to set your vertex data and render objects and so on. As the class progressed I follow this process and build on my project every week adding
aspects from the weeks lessons to my project. </p>

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
<p> Knowing how progams are structured and how all aspects of the program work togeter is a vital skill that can be applied to any project in the future. </p>

## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
<p>When working on a 3D scene there are many aspects that need to be considered. Object placement on thee seperate axis as well as camera placement and vertex data are all considerations that need to be made. When first coming into this class the primary form of visualization I had worked with was ouput formatting to be pleasing to the eyse. This takes this to a whole new level and new stategies needed to be developed to take all these new aspects into consideration. These new stratagies included visualizing the objects on the screen and their relation to space and camera placement.</p>

### How did iteration factor into your development?
<p>Iteration played a huge role in the development of the project. Each module built on the last, starting with how to render a basic window and add to it from there. So with every iteration and new concept that was added each week I added those new concepts to my project. </p>

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
<p>This has a close relation to how iteration played a role in the projects completion. When each new concept we learned such as camera position lighting etc. the developing approach would need to change in order to adjust for these new concepts. For example, when lighting was introduced, not only did we have to add normalized paramaters for the verticies we also now had to consider how that light would react with our objects. </p>

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
<p>The skills gained in this class provided me with insights outside of the usual programming concepts I have become used to working with. I think this provies a more well rounded education and will go far in helping me acheive my educatioinal goals.  </p>

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
<p>Possessing the knowledge gained from this class will help make me a more well rounded and sought after candidate in the job market. Possessing this knowledge will help aid in my future professional prospects.  </p>
