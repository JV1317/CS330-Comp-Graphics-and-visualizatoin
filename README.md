## How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
<p>Coming into this course I was new to computer graphics and using OpenGL in particular. All the skills that I have developed during this
course and while working on this project are new skills to me. All the design skills from camera view, angle and movement to object rendering, transformations
and placement are new concepts to me that I developed through this course and while working on this project. </p>

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
 <p>Each module in this course built of the last. It began with learning about how to initalize and create a windown, then about the different kinds of shaders 
and their uses and how to set your vertex data and render objects and so on. As the class progressed I follow this process and build on my project every week adding
aspects from the weeks lessons to my project. </p>

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
<p> Knowing how progams are structured and how all aspects of the program work togeter is a vital skill that can be applied to any project in the future. </p>

## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
<p>Learning about shaders and buffer objects were new to me coming into the course.  </p>
